## Description

A Python program that stores and organizes a student’s personal, academic, financial, and lifestyle information using variables, lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. It then performs some calculations and analytics (like GPA, budget, study hours, and skills comparison) and finally prints out a formatted portfolio summary.


## Features

Personal Info (Variables): Stores the student’s name, email, hometown, graduation semester, and major.

Academic Data (Lists): Tracks current and completed courses, credit hours, and GPA history.

Contact Info (Tuples): Stores emergency contacts, address, and social media information.

Interests & Skills (Sets): Keeps track of current skills, skills to learn, hobbies, career interests, and shows to watch.

Organization (Dictionaries): Maps course credits, professors, rooms, study hours, monthly budget, and key contacts.

Calculations: Total credits, cumulative GPA, study hours, academic load, monthly and annual budget breakdown, study cost per hour, media followers, skill comparison, and entertainment backlog

Output: Prints everything in a neatly formatted "Personal Academic & Life Portfolio" with academic profile, personal development, financial overview, connections, and life statistics.
